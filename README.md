# Advanced data structures in C#
Proper usage of data structures is fundamental to efficient algorithms and good software design. Knowing the inner workings and implementation details is required to choose among the data structures and for being an exemplary programmer. This repository's goal is to demonstrate how to correctly implement common and advanced  data structures in a simple and elegant way.

Simplicity and elegance are unpopular because they require hard work and discipline to achieve and education to be appreciated
